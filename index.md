MoewVP is project management for catty managers.

# The Lazy Moewfesto

1. Be really attentive to the needs of the boss until they've fully committed.
2. Undermine your detractors.  Knock their drinks over onto their laptops.  Never break eye contact.
3. Be fully committed for a while.  Then bat the project around for a while.  Now walk away.
4. Hiss loudly at anyone that says your project is less capable than the thing it replaced.
